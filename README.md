# RFC: Request For Comments
This repository is the common space where Moda Tech can come together to both solicit and provide comments on proposed system design and improvements. Through the course of executing on projects, individuals and squads will be designing systems both big and small; as they formulate those plans, they can submit a RFC here and receive feedback on the design.
